    <h1>The world of anime</h1>
    <p>Anime is a Japanese animation style that is produced or influenced by it. It is the Japanese term for cartoon or animation where the Japanese use the word to describe all cartoons irrespective of the nation. However, outside Japan, anime denotes animation movies that come exclusively from Japan, distinguished by blazing graphics, energetic characters, and attractive themes such as sci-fi, romance, and supernatural forces. Therefore, consider this syllogism: all anime shows are cartoons, but not all cartoons are anime. Here are some examples below:</p>

        <h2>Bugs Bunny</h2>
         <p> An iconic American cartoon character from the Looney Tunes series, Bugs Bunny is known for his mischievous personality and clever antics, often outsmarting his rivals like Elmer Fudd and Daffy Duck. The series, filled with slapstick comedy and fast-paced humor, is a hallmark of Western animation. While Bugs Bunny is a beloved and classic character, he is not considered anime, as Looney Tunes comes from the United States and follows the Western animation style rather than the Japanese style of anime.</p>
